## Statue of Liberty History

The Statue of Liberty measures 305 feet 1 inch from the ground to the tip of the flame, and is as tall as a 22-story building.

In 1886, it was the tallest structure in New York City.

Winds of 50 miles per hour cause the Statue to sway up to 3 inches and the torch up to 6 inches.

The total weight of the Statue's concrete foundation is 54 million pounds (27,000 tons).
